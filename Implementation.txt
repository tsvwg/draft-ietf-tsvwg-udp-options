Implementation Experience with UDP Options
==========================================

UDP Options is a product of the IETF TSVWG working group. This 
document records topics related to experience with implementing and 
using UDP Options.

sorrows of the young UDP Options",  in 2020 Network Traffic 
Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA), IEEE, 2020.

- Raffaele Zullo did a CCO implementation in a test tool with Mobile 
Tracebox Core using Android and one in Tracemore (tracebox). It was 
used to verify network traversal of the options space (showing the 
method could be used across Internet paths with and without NAPT).
- Other related results were reported in:

Checksums”, MAPRG IETF 103, Bangkok.

- Presented an updated CCO method 
(draft-ietf-fairhurst-udp-options-cco-00). The checksum proposed in 
this draft was incorporated into the current UDP Options draft as the 
content of the current OCS field.

* Tom Jones reported an implementation in a fork of FreeBSD as the 
spec was being developed in TSVWG, at IETF 101, London with prototype 
support for FreeBSD, Wireshark and Packetdrill tests. The talk has a 
pointer to the FreeBSD patch. The presentation also reported 
experiments using a prototype of DPLPMTUD, using RES/REQ exchanges, 
which at the time were proposed UDP options. They were later included 
into the WG draft, and the wire format has not changed since.

- Tom presented an update at TSVWG IETF 103 Bangkok.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvwg-sessa-51-cco-and-implementation-status-for-udp-options-02
The talk also provided measurement data (a summary of the maprg talk) 
and updated status of the prototype implementation. The prototype did 
not include the fragmentation option (note that the specification for 
that option has since been updated).

Extensions in Communication Protocols",  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF

- Mantu et al independently developed an extendable packet annotation 
tool for IP, TCP and UDP options, based on NetfilterQueue with UDP 
Options support based on draft-ietf-tsvwg-udp-options-07. This tested 
4x NOP; 4x NOP & CCO; Timestamp; Timestamp & CCO; Experimental; 
Experimental & CCO; Unassigned; Unassigned & CCO. It concluded: with 
few exceptions that all providers, other than Google, have 
exceedingly high acceptance rates. The study did not encounter any 
cases in which UDP options were stripped or modified while also 
allowing the base packet to pass.

The tabke below provides the implementation status of all currently
specified options. Those marked with (*) are mandatory to implement.

Why are the editors proposing this to be PS rather than EXP?
============================================================

This question was asked by the WG Chairs at IETF 103. Colin Perkins 
addressed  this issue at the mic, saying this is not really an 
experiment -- the spec is well-defined and just does what it does. 
Any experiment (as noted by David Black) would just be to see whether 
there is uptake. Although those comments were made 6+ years ago, the 
editors think they still hold good to this day.

This spec has received detailed scrutiny during its development. With 
detailed reviews each WGLC, and from the recent independent reviews 
(e.g., by Colin Perkins and Erik Auerswald). The editors owe these 
reviewers a lot for helping to eliminate errors and ambiguities from 
the specification of FRAG. A conformant implementation needs be able 
to reassemble just two  fragments of maximum link MTU. This removes 
most of the implementation complexity that worried Tom Jones in his 
feedback, and the most recent revision of the MRDS option makes it 
possible for senders to work within receiver implementations.
